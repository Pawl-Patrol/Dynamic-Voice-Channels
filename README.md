# The bot is no longer maintained and hosted. Please consider hosting it yourself. See below

# Dynamic Voice Channels

## Maintenance
When discord.py got discontinued in 2022, I rewrote the bot using disnake.
Then discord.py got continued again, which means another rewrite would be required to stay up to date with the ecosystem.
This will probably happen in the future. Host the bot yourself as long as it still works.

## Introduction

Have you always wanted a fast discord bot that automatically creates new voice channels and is also easy to use?  Then this bot is perfect for you. It automatically creates a new voice channel as soon as you join a certain channel and deletes it afterwards.
